## IDS - Credit Card Anomaly Detection

Dataset Used: Machine Learning Group - ULB: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Kaggle Datasets.

## Model Prediction

For building the model for this project, we will be using the following two algorithms and try to detect the anomaly detection on this dataset:

1. Isolation Forest Algorithm
2. Local Outlier Factor Algorithm

## Results

After implementation of Isolation Forest Algorithm and Local Outlier Factor Algorithm on the given Dataset we found the following results:

1. Isolation Forest detected 69 errors and its accuracy is 99.75%.
2. Local Outlier Factor detected 93 errors and its accuracy is 99.67%.
3. In case of the Isolation Forest, detection for number of the fraud cases is around 27% whereas in case Local Outlier Factor, detection for the number of fraud cases is around 2%.
4. After implementing both the methods, we can say that for determining number of the fraud cases Isolation Forest Method is better than LOF.
